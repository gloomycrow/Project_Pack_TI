# Project_Pack_TI


The script that is a Swiss army knife for computer technicians and enthusiasts, facilitating all management, maintenance, activation and cleaning of Windows OS and Microsoft Office suites.

All management is done in a simplified way without the need to run any third-party programs (YES, all the options that the script provides are from the Windows system itself) and without the need to run codes on the command line (CMD). A real hand on the wheel in the hands of technicians, simplifying and streamlining their work, thus saving time when performing maintenance on customer PCs.

There is no need for prior knowledge to use it, it is only necessary to run the program and choose the option relevant to your needs, and it can be used by any user who needs to perform software maintenance on their PCs.
    The script works on all Windows Systems (tested from Windows XP) and activation for all Office packages available on the market.
